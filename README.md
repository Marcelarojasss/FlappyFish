# 🐟 FlappyFish

FlappyFish is a Unity-based game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird — but with a fishy twist! Swim through pipes, dodge obstacles, and try not to *flop*. Built entirely in C# using Unity Engine.

## 🎮 Gameplay

You play as a flying fish trying to navigate through underwater pipes. The game tests your reflexes and timing — and it gets harder the longer you survive.

- 🖱️ **Click (or spacebar)** to make the fish jump
- 🧱 Avoid hitting the pipes or falling
- 💯 Try to beat your high score!
